The multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework has garnered significant attention in various domains, including recommender systems, information retrieval, healthcare, and finance. A simple real-world example can
enhance understanding of the multi-armed bandit problem for individuals who may be unfamiliar with
this field: A real example of the multi-armed bandit problem can be illustrated with the context of online
advertising. Imagine an online platform that wants to optimize the allocation of ad placements to maximize user engagement or click-through rates. The platform has a set of available ads (arms) and needs to
determine which ad to show to each user to achieve the highest overall performance.
