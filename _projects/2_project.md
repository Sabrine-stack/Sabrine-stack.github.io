We are concerned with a one dimensional flow of a compressible fluid which may be seen as a simplification of the flow of fluid in a long thin pipe. We assume that the pipe is on one side ended by a spring. The other side of the pipe is let open â€“ there we assume either inflow or outflow boundary conditions. Such situation can be understood as a toy model for human lungs. We tackle the question of uniqueness and existence of a strong solution for a system modelling the above process, special emphasis is laid upon the estimate of the maximal time of existence.
